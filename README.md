# 🔐 IoT-Based Smart Door Locking System with Fingerprint Sensor

A smart, secure, and efficient door locking solution that combines **IoT technology** and **biometric authentication**. This project uses an **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** and a **Fingerprint Sensor (R307)** to control a **Solenoid Lock** remotely, ensuring enhanced security and convenience in smart homes and offices.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable secure biometric door access using a fingerprint sensor  
- Eliminate the need for physical keys or passwords  
- Allow remote monitoring and control via IoT  
- Display authentication status in real-time  

## 🛠️ Components Used
- **ESP8266** – Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller for IoT connectivity  
- **Fingerprint Sensor (R307)** – Biometric access control  
- **Solenoid Lock** – Electromechanical door locking mechanism (12V)  
- **16x2 I2C LCD Display** – Real-time authentication feedback  
- **Relay Module** – Controls the solenoid lock  
- **Power Supply** – 5V/12V for different modules  

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Fingerprint is scanned using the R307 sensor  
2. ESP8266 verifies the fingerprint from stored data  
3. On successful match, the relay activates the solenoid lock to unlock the door  
4. Authentication status is displayed on the LCD  
5. The system supports **IoT-based remote monitoring**
